          	The geometrical change of an object from a current size/shape to new size/shape with change in the coordinates of the object is called as transformation.

         	A translation moves an object to a different position on the screen.

        <LI>
          	The transformation is needed to manipulate the initial object coordinate and display the modified object coordinate with the help of translation factors in X-direction defined as ‘Tx’ and Y-directions defined as ‘Ty’ as shown in figure below:

          	We can translate a point in 2-D by adding translation coordinate (Tx, Ty) to the original coordinate (x, y) to get the new 			coordinate (x’ ,y’)
		x’ = x + Tx; 
		y’= y + Ty;
        </LI>
        <LI>
         	A translation moves all the points in the object along the same straight-line path to new positions w.r.t Tx and Ty. 
        </LI>
        <LI>
          	Translation can be represented with the use of Homogenous coordinate system using matrix representation as

            where , P(x ,y) coordinate will be translated to P’(x’, y’) with respect to the translation factor ‘tx’ and ‘ty’.
